For this project, I have decided to explore deeper into e-commerce since I feel like that's where React really shines.  I would also like to expand upon my week3 project involving the airbnb data we used for an e-commerce driven SPA to make a more interactive and aesthetic site.  For products, I've been deciding between furthering an Airbnb style model of rental properties etc. or taking on using an API from a technology vendor like Newegg or Amazon.
